A lot of people move to attractive cities like New York or London looking for out of habit experiences. By comparing the mobility patterns from these two megalopolises to those showcased in the paper “Friendship and Mobility”, we hope to pinpoint trends which would justify this attraction to cities. Given that these cities are bubbling with life, we would like to investigate and understand if daily routines are still present, or if there is more entropy in human movement.
